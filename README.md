# [Bangkit 2023] C23-PS283 Product-Based Capstone Project
According to the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) report, the average beef consumption in Indonesia is 0.009 kilograms (kg) per capita in a week for the 2017â€“2021 period. However, despite the high consumption of beef, there is still a lack of awareness regarding the importance of consuming fresh beef among the public.

Therefore, we have an innovation to solve those problems. We intend to provide a meat freshness detection application called **MeatMe: Your Meat, Your Choice!**

This application can help people to detect whether the meat they buy is fresh or not by inputting the image. In addition, we plan to include a buy and sell feature in our application, allowing buyers to easily purchase fresh beef from reliable sources.
